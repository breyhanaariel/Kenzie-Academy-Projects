    <p> I'm a pretty simple girl and have had a variety of customer service jobs. But I am currently looking for a career not a job and one that allows me the opportunity to stay at home. I have some prior web design experience. A fun fact about me is: <i>my go to binge TV show is King Of The Hill.</i></p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I graduated Broward College with an Associate's in Pre-Nursing but want to switch to a more computer technical field. I have dabbled in web design langauges like HTML and CSS but all self taught. No formal education on web design or web development prior to Kenzie Academy.</p>
    
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I am a seo intern at Ad Caffeine Marketing which specializes in Wordpress sites so I know some basic coding and how to push a website/blog. I also dabble in a CMS called Drupal to make my own website to host my creative works like comics, films, and stories.</p>
    
    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
    <p>I like to think of myself as a creative person so my hobbies are artistic. My top three hobbies are drawing, reading, and writing. I love to write poems and short stories. I enjoy watercolor painting and pencil drawing. I'm a crafty person that likes to make polymer clay jewelry. I hope one day to sell a cute jewelry line on <a href="http://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a></p>
